# Credit-Scoring-using-Logistic-Regression
This project focuses on building a Credit Scoring Model using Logistic Regression, a classification technique widely used in financial analytics to assess creditworthiness. The project predicts the probability of loan default based on customer data, enabling better decision-making for lenders.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for improved model performance.
Model Development: Implementing logistic regression to classify borrowers as "Good" or "Bad" credit risks.
Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
Visualization: Creating ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance charts for detailed insights.

Use Cases:
Predicting loan default probability.
Identifying high-risk customers.
Supporting financial institutions in credit risk management.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Statsmodels

Learning Objectives:
To understand logistic regression and its application to binary classification problems.
To develop a data-driven credit scoring model for financial risk assessment.
To interpret model coefficients and evaluate performance using statistical metrics.
